# 🛠️ Setting Up the Angular Environment  

Before you start developing with Angular, you need to set up the environment properly. This includes **installing Node.js, Angular CLI, and setting up your first Angular project**. Follow these steps to get started! 🚀

## 📌 **Step 1: Install Node.js and npm**  

Angular requires **Node.js** to run its development environment. You also need **npm (Node Package Manager)** to install Angular packages.  

### ✅ **Check if Node.js is Installed**  
Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:  

```sh
node -v
```
If Node.js is installed, it will display the version number. If not, download and install **Node.js** from:  

🔗 [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  

Make sure `npm` is installed along with Node.js by running:  

```sh
npm -v
```

## 📌 **Step 2: Install Angular CLI**  

The **Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)** is a powerful tool that helps you quickly create, build, and manage Angular projects.  

### 🚀 **Install Angular CLI Globally**  

Run the following command:  

```sh
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### ✅ **Verify Installation**  
After installation, check if Angular CLI is installed correctly by running:  

```sh
ng version
```
This should display the Angular CLI version along with other environment details.

## 📌 **Step 3: Create a New Angular Project**  

Now that the Angular CLI is installed, you can create a new Angular project.  

Run the following command:  

```sh
ng new my-angular-app
```

🔹 Replace `my-angular-app` with your desired project name.  
🔹 The CLI will ask if you want to add **Angular routing** – type **Y (Yes)** if you plan to use navigation.  
🔹 Choose a **CSS preprocessor** (CSS, SCSS, LESS, or SASS) based on your preference.  

---

## 📌 **Step 4: Navigate to the Project Folder**  

Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory:  

```sh
cd my-angular-app
```

---

## 📌 **Step 5: Serve the Application**  

Start the Angular development server by running:  

```sh
ng serve
```

After running this command:  

✔️ The Angular project will compile, and the development server will start.  
✔️ Open your browser and visit:  

```
http://localhost:4200/
```

You should see the default **Angular Welcome Page**! 🎉

## 📌 **Step 6: Open the Project in VS Code (Optional but Recommended)**  

To write code efficiently, open your project in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.  

🔹 Navigate to the project folder and run:  

```sh
code .
```

🔹 If VS Code is not installed, download it here:
