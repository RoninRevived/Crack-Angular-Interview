# **ðŸš€ Handling 404 & Wildcard Routes in Angular**  

## **ðŸ”¹ What are Wildcard Routes?**  
Wildcard routes are used to handle **404 errors** (not found) by redirecting users to a specific component when they try to access a route that doesn't exist in your application. This ensures a better user experience by guiding them instead of displaying a blank page or an error.

### **ðŸ“Œ Wildcard Route Syntax**  
Wildcard routes are defined using the `**` symbol, which matches any URL not matched by previous routes.

### **ðŸ“Œ Example Route Configuration**  
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
  { path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent } // Wildcard route for 404 handling
];
```
âœ… **In this example, if the user navigates to a non-existent route, the `NotFoundComponent` will be displayed.**

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Creating a Not Found Component**  
You need to create a component that will serve as the 404 error page.

### **ðŸ“Œ Generate NotFoundComponent**  
```sh
ng generate component not-found
```
âœ… This creates `not-found.component.ts` and `not-found.component.html`.

### **ðŸ“Œ Example: not-found.component.html**
```html
<h2>404 - Page Not Found</h2>
<p>Sorry, the page you are looking for does not exist.</p>
<a routerLink="/">Go back to Home</a>
```
âœ… **This component provides a friendly message and a link to return to the home page.**

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Implementing the Wildcard Route**  
Add the wildcard route to your routing module to ensure it catches all unmatched routes.

### **ðŸ“Œ Example: app-routing.module.ts**
```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component';
import { NotFoundComponent } from './not-found/not-found.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
  { path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent } // Wildcard route for 404
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```
âœ… **The wildcard route should always be the last route in the configuration.** This is crucial, as Angular matches routes in order from top to bottom.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Navigation to Non-Existent Routes**  
When users navigate to a route that does not exist, such as `/random-route`, they will see the `NotFoundComponent`, allowing them to understand that the page is unavailable.

### **ðŸ“Œ Example: Testing the Wildcard Route**  
1. Navigate to `/about` to see the About component.
2. Navigate to `/random-route` to trigger the wildcard route.
3. The `NotFoundComponent` should display the 404 message.

---

## **ðŸš€ Best Practices for Handling 404 and Wildcard Routes**
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Ensure the not-found page has a friendly message, guiding users on what to do next (e.g., return to the home page).
- **Search Functionality**: Consider adding a search bar to help users find what theyâ€™re looking for from the 404 page.
- **Logging Errors**: Implement logging to track how often users hit 404 pages, which can help identify broken links or routes.

---

## **ðŸš€ Summary**
- **Wildcard Routes**: Use the `**` symbol to catch unmatched routes and redirect to a specific component.
- **NotFoundComponent**: Create a user-friendly 404 page that provides information and navigation options.
- **Configuration**: Always place wildcard routes at the end of your route definitions.

Implementing proper 404 handling with wildcard routes improves user experience and enhances the professionalism of your Angular application.
