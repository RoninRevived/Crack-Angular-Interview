# **ðŸš€ Implementing Micro Frontends with Angular**  

## **ðŸ”¹ Introduction to Micro Frontends in Angular**  
Implementing micro frontends in Angular allows you to build large applications by breaking them down into smaller, independent parts. This approach enables different teams to work on their specific features or components using various technologies while ensuring they can be integrated seamlessly into a single application. 

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts for Implementing Micro Frontends**  

### **ðŸ“Œ 1. Module Federation**  
Webpack 5 introduced Module Federation, which allows you to load modules from other applications at runtime. This feature is essential for implementing micro frontends, as it enables the sharing of code between different Angular applications without requiring a full rebuild.

### **ðŸ“Œ 2. Single-SPA**  
Single-SPA is a framework for building micro frontends. It allows you to use multiple frameworks in a single application and handles the loading and unloading of micro frontends based on the current route.

### **ðŸ“Œ 3. Angular Elements**  
Angular Elements enables you to create custom elements (web components) from Angular components. This allows you to use Angular components in non-Angular applications or to create independent micro frontends that can be consumed by other frameworks.

## **ðŸ”¹ Steps to Implement Micro Frontends in Angular**  

### **ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Set Up Your Angular Projects**  
Create separate Angular projects for each micro frontend. You can use the Angular CLI to create new projects:

```bash
ng new microfrontend1 --routing
ng new microfrontend2 --routing
```

### **ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Configure Module Federation**  
Add Webpack 5 support to your projects and configure Module Federation in the `webpack.config.js` file for each micro frontend. Here's an example configuration:

**microfrontend1/webpack.config.js:**
```javascript
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require("webpack").container.ModuleFederationPlugin;

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: "microfrontend1",
      filename: "remoteEntry.js",
      exposes: {
        './Component': './src/app/component/component.module.ts',
      },
      shared: {
        "@angular/core": { singleton: true },
        "@angular/common": { singleton: true },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

### **ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Set Up Routing**  
Set up routing in the main application to load micro frontends based on the route. Use `loadRemoteModule` from `@angular-architects/module-federation` to load remote modules dynamically.

**Main Application Routing Example:**
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'microfrontend1',
    loadChildren: () => import('microfrontend1/Component').then(m => m.ComponentModule),
  },
  {
    path: 'microfrontend2',
    loadChildren: () => import('microfrontend2/Component').then(m => m.ComponentModule),
  },
];
```

### **ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Create Angular Elements**  
If you want to create micro frontends as web components, you can convert Angular components into Angular Elements.

**Example of Creating an Angular Element:**
```typescript
import { createCustomElement } from '@angular/elements';
import { Component, Injector } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-element',
  template: `<h1>Hello from Angular Element!</h1>`,
})
export class MyElement {}

@NgModule({
  declarations: [MyElement],
  entryComponents: [MyElement],
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(private injector: Injector) {
    const el = createCustomElement(MyElement, { injector });
    customElements.define('my-element', el);
  }

  ngDoBootstrap() {}
}
```

### **ðŸ“Œ Step 5: Deploy Micro Frontends**  
Once your micro frontends are set up, deploy each application independently. Ensure that the main application can access the remote entries of the micro frontends.

### **ðŸ“Œ Step 6: Handle Communication Between Micro Frontends**  
For inter-micro frontend communication, you can use shared services, event buses, or custom events to facilitate communication between different parts of your application.
