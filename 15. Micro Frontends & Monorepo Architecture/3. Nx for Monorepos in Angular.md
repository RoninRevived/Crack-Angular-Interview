# **ðŸš€ Nx for Monorepos in Angular**  

## **ðŸ”¹ Introduction to Nx**  
Nx is a powerful set of extensible dev tools that helps you manage monorepos, which are repositories that contain multiple applications and libraries. It is particularly well-suited for Angular applications, providing tools and features to improve development efficiency, streamline workflows, and enhance collaboration across teams. By using Nx, you can share code, libraries, and components between applications easily.

## **ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Nx**  

### **ðŸ“Œ 1. Integrated Development Tools**  
Nx provides a suite of tools and plugins for Angular, including schematics, generators, and builders, which simplify common tasks like creating components, services, and entire applications.

### **ðŸ“Œ 2. Dependency Graph**  
Nx automatically analyzes your workspace to generate a visual dependency graph. This graph helps you understand how applications and libraries are connected, making it easier to manage dependencies.

### **ðŸ“Œ 3. Code Sharing**  
Nx encourages code sharing by allowing you to create libraries that can be reused across multiple applications. This promotes consistency and reduces code duplication.

### **ðŸ“Œ 4. Incremental Builds**  
Nx supports incremental builds, allowing you to only build and test the affected projects rather than the entire workspace. This leads to faster development cycles and improved performance.

### **ðŸ“Œ 5. Testing and Linting**  
Nx integrates with testing frameworks like Jest and Cypress, making it easier to set up and run tests for your applications and libraries. It also supports linting with ESLint to ensure code quality.

### **ðŸ“Œ 6. Workspace Management**  
Nx provides commands to manage your workspace efficiently, including tasks for running, serving, and building applications, as well as managing libraries and dependencies.

## **ðŸ”¹ Getting Started with Nx in Angular**  

### **ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Install Nx CLI**  
To get started with Nx, install the Nx CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g nx
```

### **ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Create a New Nx Workspace**  
Create a new Nx workspace for your Angular applications:

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace my-workspace
```

Follow the prompts to choose the preset and set up your workspace.

### **ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Generate Angular Applications and Libraries**  
You can generate new Angular applications and libraries using Nx commands. For example, to create a new Angular application:

```bash
nx generate @nrwl/angular:application my-app
```

To create a new library:

```bash
nx generate @nrwl/angular:library my-lib
```

### **ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Visualize the Dependency Graph**  
Use the Nx CLI to generate a visual dependency graph of your workspace:

```bash
nx dep-graph
```

This command opens a browser window displaying the dependency graph, allowing you to analyze the relationships between applications and libraries.

### **ðŸ“Œ Step 5: Run Tests and Linting**  
Run tests for your applications and libraries:

```bash
nx test my-app
```

Lint your codebase to maintain code quality:

```bash
nx lint
```

### **ðŸ“Œ Step 6: Build and Serve Applications**  
Build your applications with:

```bash
nx build my-app
```

Serve your application locally:

```bash
nx serve my-app
```
