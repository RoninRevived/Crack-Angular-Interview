# **ðŸš€ Singleton Services vs. Non-Singleton Services in Angular**  

## **ðŸ”¹ Introduction to Services in Angular**  
In Angular, services are a fundamental way to share data and functionality across components. Understanding the difference between singleton services and non-singleton services is essential for managing state, performance, and memory usage in your application.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Singleton Services**  
Singleton services are created once and shared across the entire application. This means that only one instance of the service exists throughout the application, regardless of how many components or modules inject it. Singleton services are typically used for global state management or utility functions.

### **ðŸ“Œ How Singleton Services Work**  
When you provide a service in the root module or use the `providedIn: 'root'` syntax, Angular creates a singleton instance of that service.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root', // Singleton service
})
export class AuthService {
  private isLoggedIn = false;

  login() {
    this.isLoggedIn = true;
  }

  logout() {
    this.isLoggedIn = false;
  }

  isAuthenticated() {
    return this.isLoggedIn;
  }
}
```
âœ… **In this example, `AuthService` is a singleton service that manages authentication state. All components that inject `AuthService` will share the same instance.**

### **ðŸ“Œ Advantages of Singleton Services**
- **Shared State**: Singleton services are ideal for managing application-wide state, such as user authentication or configuration settings.
- **Performance**: Reduced memory usage since only one instance of the service is created.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent behavior across components, as all share the same instance.

## **ðŸ”¹ Non-Singleton Services**  
Non-singleton services, on the other hand, create a new instance each time they are injected. This behavior is achieved by providing the service at the component or module level rather than at the root level.

### **ðŸ“Œ How Non-Singleton Services Work**  
When you provide a service in the `providers` array of a component or a specific module, Angular creates a new instance of that service for each component or module that requests it.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class CounterService {
  count = 0;

  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-counter',
  template: '<button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>',
  providers: [CounterService] // Non-singleton service
})
export class CounterComponent {
  constructor(private counterService: CounterService) {}

  increment() {
    this.counterService.increment();
    console.log(`Current count: ${this.counterService.count}`);
  }
}
```
âœ… **In this example, `CounterService` is provided in the `CounterComponent`, meaning each instance of `CounterComponent` will have its own instance of `CounterService`.**

### **ðŸ“Œ Advantages of Non-Singleton Services**
- **Independent State**: Each component can have its own instance of the service, allowing for independent state management. This is useful for services that maintain component-specific data.
- **Flexibility**: Non-singleton services can be easily instantiated with different configurations, providing more flexibility in component behavior.

## **ðŸ”¹ When to Use Each Type**  

### **ðŸ“Œ Use Singleton Services When:**
- You need to manage global state (e.g., authentication, user settings).
- You want to share utility functions across multiple components.
- You need consistent behavior across the application.

### **ðŸ“Œ Use Non-Singleton Services When:**
- You need isolated state management for specific components.
- You want to create component-specific services that can hold unique data.
- You need different configurations for instances based on component context.

---

## **ðŸš€ Summary**
- **Singleton Services**: Created once and shared throughout the application. Ideal for managing global state and utility functions.
- **Non-Singleton Services**: New instances are created for each injection. Useful for managing component-specific state and allowing independent configurations.
