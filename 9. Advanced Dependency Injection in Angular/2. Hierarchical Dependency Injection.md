# **ðŸš€ Hierarchical Dependency Injection in Angular**  

## **ðŸ”¹ Introduction to Hierarchical Dependency Injection**  
Angular's dependency injection (DI) system is hierarchical, meaning that it organizes services and their dependencies in a tree structure based on Angular modules (NgModules). This hierarchical model allows Angular to manage service instances at different levels, providing flexibility and optimizing resource usage in your application.

### **ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts of Hierarchical Dependency Injection**
- **Root Injector**: The top-level injector created when the application starts. It holds singleton instances of services provided in the root module.
- **Child Injectors**: Created for each feature module or component that declares its own providers. Child injectors can override or extend the services from the root injector.
- **Service Scope**: The scope of a service (singleton vs. per-instance) is determined by where it is provided.

## **ðŸ”¹ How Hierarchical DI Works**  

### **ðŸ“Œ Root Injector**
When an Angular application starts, a root injector is created for the root module. Services provided at this level are singletons, meaning only one instance is created for the entire application.

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root', // Provided in the root injector
})
export class GlobalService {
  // This service is a singleton
}
```
âœ… **In this example, `GlobalService` is provided in the root injector, ensuring a single instance across the application.**

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Child Injectors**
Child injectors are created when a feature module or component declares its own providers. These child injectors can provide instances of services that either extend or override those from the root injector.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class FeatureService {
  // This service can be provided at the feature module level
}

@NgModule({
  declarations: [FeatureComponent],
  providers: [FeatureService], // Creates a child injector
})
export class FeatureModule {}
```
#### **Usage in a Component**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-feature',
  template: '<h1>Feature Component</h1>',
  providers: [FeatureService] // Can also be provided at the component level
})
export class FeatureComponent {
  constructor(private featureService: FeatureService) {}
}
```
âœ… **In this example, `FeatureService` is provided at the feature module level, creating a child injector for that module.**

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Service Resolution and Lookup Process**  
When a component or service requests a dependency, Angular follows a specific resolution process:

1. **Check the Component/Module Injector**: Angular first checks if the service is available in the injector of the component or module requesting it.
2. **Check Parent Injectors**: If the service is not found, Angular traverses up the injector tree to the parent module or the root injector, checking for the service until it either finds it or reaches the root injector.
3. **Create a New Instance**: If the service is provided in the child injector, Angular creates a new instance for that scope. If it's provided in the root injector, the existing singleton instance is returned.

## **ðŸ”¹ Example of Hierarchical DI**

### **ðŸ“Œ Service Definition**
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ParentService {
  constructor() {
    console.log('ParentService instance created');
  }
}

@Injectable()
export class ChildService {
  constructor() {
    console.log('ChildService instance created');
  }
}
```

### **ðŸ“Œ Module and Component Setup**
```typescript
@NgModule({
  providers: [ParentService], // Provided in the parent module
})
export class ParentModule {}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: '<h1>Child Component</h1>',
  providers: [ChildService], // Provided in the child component
})
export class ChildComponent {
  constructor(private parentService: ParentService, private childService: ChildService) {}
}
```
### **ðŸ“Œ Application Module**
```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [ChildComponent],
  imports: [ParentModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```
### **ðŸ“Œ Console Output**
When the `ChildComponent` is instantiated, the console will show:
```
ParentService instance created
ChildService instance created
```
âœ… **This shows that the `ParentService` from the parent injector and `ChildService` from the child injector were both created.**

## **ðŸš€ Summary**
- **Hierarchical Dependency Injection**: Angular organizes providers in a tree structure, allowing for flexible service resolution.
- **Root Injector**: Holds singleton instances of services provided in the root module.
- **Child Injectors**: Created for feature modules and components, enabling scoped instances and overriding services from the root injector.
- **Service Resolution Process**: Angular checks the local injector first and then traverses up the tree to find dependencies.
