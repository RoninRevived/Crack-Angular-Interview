# **ðŸš€ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Angular**  

## **ðŸ”¹ Introduction to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security paradigm that restricts system access to authorized users based on their roles. In an application, roles define the permissions granted to users, allowing developers to control access to various features and resources based on user roles.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Why Use RBAC?**  
RBAC helps manage user permissions efficiently by grouping users with similar access needs into roles. This approach simplifies security management, enhances compliance, and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

### **ðŸ“Œ Benefits of RBAC**  
1. **Granular Control**: Define specific permissions for different roles, providing fine-grained access control.
2. **Easier Management**: Simplify user management by grouping permissions into roles instead of assigning them individually to users.
3. **Scalability**: Easily add new roles or modify existing roles without affecting individual user permissions.

## **ðŸ”¹ Implementing RBAC in Angular**  

### **ðŸ“Œ 1. Define Roles and Permissions**  
Start by defining the roles in your application and the associated permissions. For example:

- **Admin**: Full access to all features.
- **Editor**: Can create and edit content but cannot delete.
- **Viewer**: Can only view content.

### **ðŸ“Œ 2. User Model with Roles**  
Extend your user model to include a `roles` property that contains the roles assigned to each user.

```typescript
export interface User {
  id: number;
  username: string;
  roles: string[]; // e.g., ['Admin', 'Editor']
}
```

### **ðŸ“Œ 3. Role Guard**  
Create an Angular guard to protect routes based on user roles. The guard checks if the user has the required role to access a specific route.

#### **Example of a Role Guard**  
```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot, Router } from '@angular/router';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class RoleGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService, private router: Router) {}

  canActivate(
    next: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
    state: RouterStateSnapshot
  ): boolean {
    const expectedRoles = next.data.expectedRoles;
    const user = this.authService.getCurrentUser();

    if (user && expectedRoles.some(role => user.roles.includes(role))) {
      return true;
    } else {
      // Redirect to unauthorized page or login
      this.router.navigate(['/unauthorized']);
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

### **ðŸ“Œ 4. Protect Routes**  
Apply the `RoleGuard` to your routes, specifying the required roles in the route data.

#### **Example of Protecting Routes**  
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'admin', component: AdminComponent, canActivate: [RoleGuard], data: { expectedRoles: ['Admin'] } },
  { path: 'editor', component: EditorComponent, canActivate: [RoleGuard], data: { expectedRoles: ['Editor', 'Admin'] } },
  { path: 'view', component: ViewerComponent, canActivate: [RoleGuard], data: { expectedRoles: ['Viewer', 'Editor', 'Admin'] } },
];
```

### **ðŸ“Œ 5. Role-Based UI Elements**  
In addition to route protection, you can conditionally render UI elements based on the user's roles. For example, show or hide buttons based on permissions.

#### **Example of Conditional Rendering**  
```html
<button *ngIf="userService.hasRole('Admin')">Delete</button>
<button *ngIf="userService.hasRole('Editor')">Edit</button>
```

### **ðŸ“Œ 6. User Service for Role Management**  
Create a service to manage user authentication and role checks.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class UserService {
  private user: User;

  constructor() {
    // Assume user is set after authentication
    this.user = { id: 1, username: 'admin', roles: ['Admin'] }; // Example user
  }

  getCurrentUser(): User {
    return this.user;
  }

  hasRole(role: string): boolean {
    return this.user.roles.includes(role);
  }
}
```

## **ðŸš€ Summary**
- **RBAC Overview**: Role-Based Access Control provides a structured way to manage user permissions based on roles.
- **Implementation Steps**: Define roles, create guards, protect routes, and manage role-based UI rendering.
- **Benefits**: Simplifies permission management, enhances security, and provides scalability for future requirements.
